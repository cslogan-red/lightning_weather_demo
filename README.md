# lightning_weather_demo
Quick SFDC/WeatherUnderground mashup/responsive prototype I threw together to demo custom
Lightning components and the Lightning Design System CSS framework
built on top of FlexBox.

Includes all components necessary to compile and build app, replace WeatherStatics.API_KEY
with your WeatherUnderground API key to make RESTful API calls to WeatherUnderground work
(free to create a developer account)
